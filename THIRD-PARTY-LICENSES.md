Notes and recommended actions
-----------------------------
- Please verify the exact copyright holder(s) and any NOTICE files in the original
  `@simplewebauthn` repository and preserve any required copyright or NOTICE text
  when redistributing or including substantial portions of their code.
- This project itself is licensed under the MIT license (see `package.json` and `README.md`).
- If you want, we can add file-level headers to the specific files that were adapted
  (e.g., `src/spec/*`, `src/utils/simplewebauthn-server.js`) to include a short attribution
  comment linking to the original repository and its license.

If you want me to add those file headers or create a `LICENSES` folder with per-dependency
license files, tell me which option you prefer and I will add them.
